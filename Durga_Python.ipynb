    "        \n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Freeware and opensource\n",
    "        Freeware:\n",
    "            Liscence fee is not required therefore, Freeware. Foundation is responsible to maintain, Python Software Foundation (PSF). Scope of using this languange is large because of no cost or liscence fee. PSF is a non-profit organisation.\n",
    "        Opensource:\n",
    "            The Python source code is open to all. You can customize and use it for your specific purposes.\n",
    "            \n",

    "        Not needed to worry about low level activities.\n",
    "        Memory allocation, security, etc, is done by Python\n",
    "        \n",
    "    4. Platform independent\n",
    "        Three platform: Windows, Linux, Mac\n",
    "        When we write an application in C, we need to write three different applications for each platform. That's why C is a platform depedent language.\n",
    "        Python Virtual Machine (PVM) for Windows is required, similarly we require PVM for Linux and Mac. So here we have only one program/application. Now this can be run on any platform therefore it is called platform independent. PVM is platform dependent.\n",
